- Double-vote prevention
- Mock tally

#### 2. View Deployment (1 minute)
Visit: https://solscan.io/account/APdSGnQuogNbYga3CZUZfSRpAz4agdufXbEPbGCCt9by?cluster=devnet

#### 3. Check Code Quality (5 minutes)
- `crates/crypto/src/elgamal.rs` - Production Curve25519
- `programs/privacy-layer/src/lib.rs` - Solana program
- `sdk/src/client.ts` - TypeScript SDK

#### 4. Run Benchmarks (2 minutes)
```bash
yarn benchmark
```

## 🛠️ What's Deferred (By Design)

For **production-grade MVP**, these are explicitly deferred:

### ⏳ Phase 2: ZK Proofs (2-3 weeks)
- Circom circuit implementation
- Groth16 proof generation
- On-chain verification

**Status**: Architecture ready, hooks in place

### ⏳ Phase 3: Full MPC (2-3 weeks)
- Arcium MXE integration
- Distributed key generation
- Threshold decryption

**Status**: Design complete, can use mock for now

### ⏳ Phase 4: Production (2-3 weeks)
- Security audit
- Gas optimization
- Integration testing
- Mainnet deployment

**Status**: Foundation solid, clear roadmap
